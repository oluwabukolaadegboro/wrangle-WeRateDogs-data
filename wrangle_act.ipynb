    "3. **What is the favorite count for each dog stage?**: Doggos have a higher favorite count (approx. 15,601) and retweet_count (approx. 4,454) on average when compared to other dog stages. Next is the puppo, fluffer, and pupper with an approximate favorite count of 10352, 7939, and 6307 likes respectively. Therefore, doggos are popularly admired more when compared to the other dog stages and this could be associated with the fact that they are older and often more composed/well-behaved."

Following this, the model tends to also predict three others namely; 'Pomeranian', 'Labrador Retriever' and 'Pembroke' in no significant order. From the plot above, the algorithm also makes some mistakes by wrongly predicting other animals as 'dogs' e.g. 'porcupine', 'Siamese cat' and 'wombat', however when compared to the other 22 out of 25 i.e (88%) correct predictions made by the model, the 3 out of 25 (i.e 12%) wrong predictions are minimal."

For example, the model was able to properly learn and identify the distinct features of the 'Bernese Mountain dog' with a 97.7% confidence score. This is same with the other 9 predictions where the model could predict them with a confidence score greater than 80%. In addition, though the 'Bernese Mountain dog' was not commonly predicted as often by the model, the model could the distinguish its features with a high confidence score."

From analysis, images of doggos are also among the most retweeted images with a high retweet count of approximately 4,454 when combined on an average. Hence, doggos tend to be more popularly admired when compared to other dog stages and this could be attributed to the fact that they are older and often more composed/well-behaved."
